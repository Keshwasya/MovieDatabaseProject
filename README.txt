Movie Database Project
Daniel Bala & Keshwasya Singh

From the last check-in, we have added movie/people/user searching and dynamic loading of the accompanying objects and redirection to relevant HTML files. We have also added various routers to handle this and have begun preparing the groundwork to include MongoDB instead of reading from the JSON files. Users can click on "Show full database" and filter and search through movies with accompanying filters. We also added sessions and user authentications for certain features. A log in and out functions. We have all rest api supported.
